= WSL2

== Setup

To stop WSL from overwriting `/etc/hosts` every time it starts, disable automatic host generation in WSL to add the custom DINA entries.
Added `generateHosts = false` to `/etc/wsl.conf`.

In WSL the content of `/etc/hosts` should be changed to:

[source, bash]
----
127.0.0.1 dina.local
127.0.0.1 api.dina.local
127.0.0.1 keycloak.dina.local
----
