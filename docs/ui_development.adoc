= dina-ui Development

To enable dina-ui hot-reloading in dina-local-deployment, you need to configure the dina-ui repo location.
This variable is stored in the `.env` as `DINA_UI_REPO_DIRECTORY`. By default it looks in the home directory for dina-ui.

Any changes to the pointed `DINA_UI_REPO_DIRECTORY` will cause the page to automatically reload.

To use, simply add the override docker-compose configuration for dev: `-f docker-compose.dev.yml`.

You can also still use profiles or combine this with RabbitMQ messaging as well.
