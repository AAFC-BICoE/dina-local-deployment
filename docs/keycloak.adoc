= Keycloak


== Settings

Traefik is responsible for TLS termination so Keycloak is configured with `KC_PROXY: edge`.


Keycloak Admin console is available at `https://keycloak.dina.local/auth`.

The main reason for having the admin console on a different hostname is to simplify the rules for not exposing it.
