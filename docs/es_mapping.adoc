= How to Update ElasticSearch Mapping

Mapping settings are stored under `elastic-configurator-settings` folder.

To add a new field to Elasticsearch mapping file, first identify the correct location in the nested properties structure where the field belongs. Most fields are under 
`mappings → properties → data → properties → attributes → properties` and nested documents (representing the relationship) would go under `mappings → properties → included → properties → attributes → properties`.
Insert your new field definition with its type (ElasticSearch type).
