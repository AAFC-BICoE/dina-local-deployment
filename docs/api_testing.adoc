= API Endpoint Testing

== Applications

Any REST API client with OAuth2 support can be used. Below are some examples of software you can use:

* *Postman* - Download (Login Required)
* *Insomnia* - Download (No Login Required)

== Authentication

On each request, you will need to set up the following Authentication settings:

.Authentication Settings
|===
|Setting |Value

|Authentication Type
|OAuth 2.0

|Grant Type
|Authorization Code

|Authorization URL / Auth URL
|http://keycloak.local:8080/auth/realms/dina/protocol/openid-connect/auth

|Access Token URL
|http://keycloak.local:8080/auth/realms/dina/protocol/openid-connect/token

|Client ID
|objectstore

|Redirect URL / Callback URL
|http://dina.local

|Scope
|openid
|===

Then when sending the request, you should see a popup which will let you login to the DINA application. Once you do this, your login will be remembered for the session and tokens will be automatically generated.

In Postman you will have to click the "Get New Access Token" button to see this popup.

== Logout of Session



== Headers

Most of the API POST requests require a specific "Content-Type" header.
