= API Endpoint Testing

== Applications

Any REST API client with OAuth2 support can be used. Below are some examples of software you can use:

* *Insomnia* - https://insomnia.rest/download[Download] (No Login Required)
* *Postman* - https://www.postman.com/downloads/[Download] (Login Required)

== Authentication

On each request, you will need to set up the following Authentication settings:

.Authentication Settings
|===
|Setting |Value

|Authentication Type
|OAuth 2.0

|Grant Type
|Authorization Code

|Authorization URL / Auth URL
|https://dina.local/auth/realms/dina/protocol/openid-connect/auth

|Access Token URL
|https://dina.local/auth/realms/dina/protocol/openid-connect/token

|Client ID
|dina-public

|Redirect URL / Callback URL
|https://dina.local

|Scope
|openid
|===

Then when sending the request, you should see a popup which will let you login to the DINA application. Once you do this, your login will be remembered for the session and tokens will be automatically generated.

In Postman you will have to click the "Get New Access Token" button to see this popup.

== Logout of Session

Sometimes you might need to login as a different user for testing, the instructions for clearing your sessions are below:

To logout of your session on the Insomnia application, simply go to the authentication tab and at the bottom of the panel there is a "Clear" button. Next time you send an API request you will be prompted again to login.

For Postman, in the Authorization section there is a text field with your current access token. Selecting and removing the access token will remove your session. To re-login, scroll to the bottom for the "Get New Access Token" button.

== Headers

Most of the API POST requests require a specific "Content-Type" header. 

.Common Headers
|===
|Key |Value |Description

|Content-Type
|application/vnd.api+json
|This is only required for POST requests, by default Postman and Insomnia might put `application/json` which will cause an error.

|Crnk-Compact
|true
|Optional. Self and related links can make up to 60% of the response payload size and not always are those links of use. In this case the computation of those links is omitted. Further relationships without data are completely omitted.
